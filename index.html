      <h2>Career satisfaction actually has a significant impact on our physical & mental health.</h2>
      <p>Which means, it's not very ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù to spend our days at a job we're unhappy with. 
      <p>Building a fulfilling career is not necessarily easy or straightforward, nor something that can be achieved overnight. It might require hard work, planning and perseverance. Or perhaps it takes years of trial and error to find what works best for you.</p> 
      <p>But whatever it takes, finding a job you love is certainly worth it‚Äîbecause over time, an enjoyable and fulfilling career will pay off dividends in your overall health and well-being.</p> 
      

      <h2>Steps for building a fulfilling + intentional career</h2>
      <p>Try the following steps to get on a career path you're truly happy to be on:</p>

      <h2>1. Think about what you enjoy doing</h2>
      <p>First, think about and get in touch with things or activities that bring you joy.</p>
      <p><i>What do you enjoy doing?</i> </p>
      <p><i>What would you do even if you weren't paid for it?</i></p>   
      <p><i>What do people say you're good at?</i></p>


      <h2>2. Imagine your ideal work day</h2>
      <p>Once you establish the things you love doing, now think about how you'd actually like to spend your time doing them. What do you envision your work days being like?</p>
      <p>Some people like working in an office environment with a team. Others like working by themselves. You may even want to work outside or in a new place everyday. </p>
      <p>We spend many hours each day at our jobs, so finding the right environment is crucial to cultivating a career we love.</p>  
          
      <h2>3. Brainstorm careers that let you follow your dreams</h2>
      <p>Now it's time to translate your career purpose into a job title! üôå What careers allow you to follow your dreams? 
      <p>This might require you to visit your trusted friend Google to see your options. You can also browse job sites like Indeed, Idealist or LinkedIn to look at job postings and read job descriptions. Don't worry‚Äîwe aren't applying for anything yet. This is all still research!</p>
      <p>Start exploring to see what's out there and pay attention to what feels oooh exciting as you come across it. Often, your gut instinct will guide you as you read a job description: does it light you up to consider yourself in that role, or does it bring up feelings of gloom and doom? This is all a helpful part of your ideal career research!</p>

      <h2>4. Consider barriers along the way</h2>
      <p>Once you have a working list of potential jobs, narrow them down. Meaning, find which options are feasible for you, on the timeline and resources you're working with. </p>
      <p>What are the ‚Äúbarriers to entry‚Äù of different positions? Are there any educational requirements or certifications you'll need? Maybe a certain job would require moving to a new location, or other lifestyle change?</p>
      <p>Career path roadblocks aren't necessarily un-crossable. Some of the barriers to entry you may encounter could reasonably be overcome with a little creativity and the resources you have available. And others are perhaps a far stretch for this lifetime.</p> 
      <p>But, try not to let these barriers get discouraging. The trick is to be conscious of potential barriers upfront, so you can determine </p>


      <h2>5. Get advice from others in the field</h2>
      <p>It can be hugely helpful to learn from others who have done what you're trying to do.</p>
      <p>Find successful people in the field you'd like to break into, and invite them out for a coffee so you can pick their brain. How did they get into their career? Would they recommend working at their current job? What type of training did they have, or what jobs did they have before this one? What lessons have they learned along the way?</p>
      <p>Everyone is different, so keep in mind that their experience may be different from yours. </p>


      <h2>6. Create an actionable timeline</h2>
      <p>Once you have this background information about your dream career and some practical steps needed to get there‚Ä¶ visualize it! </p>
      <p>Part of visualizing is to lay out an actionable timeline to get from where you are to where you'd like to be.</p>
      <p><i>Steps need to be taken to prepare for your dream job?</i> </p>
      <p><i>How will these steps fit into your lifestyle?</i></p>
      <p><i>What can you do to prepare mentally or physically?</i></p>
      <p>Write down everything you'll need from start to finish. Then cross it off as you get there. New professional certificate? Check. References from a previous employer? Check. Financial planning to build savings for a career switch? Check.</p>
      <p>This road map you create will guide your actions and help you get just where you need to be. That way, you'll know when it's time to take the leap and finally snag your new position.</p>
